# Grand Circus - Student Grades Statistics Lab

The extended challenge in this lab asked us to play the part of a teacher grading a test. Given the statistics of the list of scores by students, we were to either recommend or not recommend curving the grades.

What do we know about the data? We know that the average was around 60, which is a D (ie failing). We also know that the median and mode are 60 exactly. This means the data follows a normal distribution and is not skewed in any particular direction. We also know the standard deviation of this dataset (25.77), meaning 68.2% of all test scores fall between roughly a score of 34 to a score of 86. This means the majority of students scored below an A. Taken altogether, these statistics do not paint a pretty picture of the distribution of test scores. Given the average was in the failing range, and that this data follows a normal distribution, I would recommend curving the grades to ensure the average (mean) was at least passing, and in a way that keeps the data close to a normal distribution.
